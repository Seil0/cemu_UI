# cemu_UI

cemu_UI is a simple, material design graphical frontend for [cemu](http://cemu.info/), a Wii U emulator. Downloads can be found [here](https://github.com/Seil0/cemu_UI/releases).

## Installation
Simply download the cemu_UI.jar from [releases](https://github.com/Seil0/cemu_UI/releases), make sure you have the latest version of java 8 oracle jre/jdk installed, open the file. cemu_UI creats a new directory "C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\cemu_UI", where the database, settings and covers are stored. **first start can take while!**
